This is a beginner-friendly Movie Recommendation System that suggests similar Bollywood movies based on the movie you input.
It uses content-based filtering by comparing the genre/tags of movies using machine learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview
🔍 Input: Movie name (like 3 Idiots, Raazi, etc.)
📤 Output: 5 most similar movies from a pre-defined Bollywood dataset
🧠 Technique: Content-Based Filtering using:
CountVectorizer (Text vectorization)
Cosine Similarity (to find similar movies)

🖥️ Frontend: HTML form inside Flask (inline UI)
⚙️ Backend: Python + Flask + scikit-learn + pandas

 Limitations -->
Uses a fixed dataset of 15 Bollywood movies
Does not use user ratings (no collaborative filtering)
